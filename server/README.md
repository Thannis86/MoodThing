Reflections:

Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
REQUIREMENT MET - The application must include both client-side and server-side code.
REQUIREMENT MET - Ensure the application is fully responsive and works across modern browsers.
REQUIREMENT MET - Use Express.js to set up your server and define API endpoints.
REQUIREMENT MET - Use Supabase with the PG library for database operations.
REQUIREMENT MET - Implement async/await and the Fetch API for non-blocking database operations and API calls.
REQUIREMENT MET - Demonstrate an understanding of database design, relationships, and SQL queries.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
- We met all of our goals
- We met 2 of our stretch goals (include emojis, and include form and calendar on a single page).
- After discussing it in our team review before the presentation, we realised that our stretch goal of a visual representation for a strength of an emotion would have been easy to add but unfortunately we did not have enough time be able to implement it
- Our other stretch goal of sharing the content also wasn't met. We didn't have a clear idea of how we would implement this (e.g. direct exporting of the information or just sharing the page).

ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
- Our biggest problem was working with git branches, where it wouldn't merge or pull properly, and at one point we needed Joe's help to push properly.
- Another issue was keeping track of elements and classes in the CSS. We organised them and used semantic text, but still found it difficult. 
- Both of these things likely come with experience. We have noticed ourselves getting better at using them throughout the assignment.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
- Group collaboration and assigning tasks to team members
- Regular communication, regular push/pulls to ensure we are all working alongside each other
- We were occasionally confused about what we were all visualising - using more visual references would make it easier

Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
- We googled several things to ensure we were on the right track (StackOverflow was useful as other devs had experienced similar problems in the past)
- ChatGPT - we used this tool to write some basic journal entries in for us... to save time!
- TechEd moodle resources
- MDN Docs

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.
- CSS styling. We had some issues with CSS styling which was mostly due to being out of practice. We also did some pair and mob programming when we worked on media queries which helped us all align and learn from each other.
- GitHub Branch issues. We encountered some issues with GitHub branches and sought help from Joe and Manny twice to ensure we were merging things correctly.
- Calendar Grid. We came across a lot of issues with getting and posting the data, and how it would display the data received. The calendar was the biggest issue - whenever we updated any columns or data, we would often have to update the calendar code
